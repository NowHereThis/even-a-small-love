                        They taught me to R.S.V.P mentally for my own creative growth & career; to plan & project/ aim for a larger plan for myself. To not mentally put myself on the sidelines while I watch others grow because I was too scared to make the wrong move. However, the greatest mistake is to stay stagnant.

                        I've never met anybody as spontaneous, intuitive & decisive as them. Things I'm both in awe of & envious of. Messaging/ talking for hours no matter the time difference & hearing them genuinely embody a "don't think, just do" attitude regarding their career was mind opening. For them, to achieve success is to risk all stability & comforts. To throw their 'plan b' out the window & get into a survival mindset to create a deep hunger/drive for success. I used to tell them how that all intimates me. During times of great self doubt, they would patiently answer all my "what if's?," whether it be about my technical/creative abilities & or my all too safe mindset/ lifestyle. They tirelessly affirmed & validated me whenever they sensed I needed it the most. I used to deny all these words of comfort. Looking back now, if someone you respect/ draw such inspiration from & is in this much love with, believes in you as well as your potential to such extremes, you better believe what they're saying & start doing the same for yourself. Hit the ground running & make them proud.
