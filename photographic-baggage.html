                        This was the last letter my ex sent to me after I broke up with him. He had threatened to commit suicide on several occasions during our almost 3-year long relationship from January 2006 to December 2008. The last straw was after a difficult phone call, as I had just moved back to Washington, from Ohio.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="text">
                        Our plan was for him to move to Washington after I had settled back in and found a job. He backtracked on our plans and announced he would go back to school, and would not move to Seattle. He was asked me to move back. I stood my ground and said no. I had just spent a miserable year and a half living in Cleveland. He angrily suggested that maybe we should break-up if I wasn't going to change my mind. I agreed that we should, and then he said, "Well, I am just going to kill myself then." and hung up. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="text">
                        Terrified, I called him back multiple times. He didn't pick-up. I called both of his siblings, his parents, and his parent's work. No one was picking up the phone and I was in a panic, thinking something actually happened. I spent the next 3 hours a wreck. Then he called me back. He said, "Sorry, I fell asleep". I was furious, told him he needed to see a therapist, and broke up with him.
                    </p>
